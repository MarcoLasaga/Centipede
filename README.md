# Centipede Game (Java)

This is a personal hobby project where I recreate classic arcade games using Java.  

The first game I tackled is *Centipede*, featuring:

- Player movement and shooting
- Centipede with segment following
- Mushroom obstacles
- Enemy bullets and collisions
- Sprite-based graphics
- Sound and particle effects
- Modular, object-oriented design

## Controls

- **Left / Right Arrow**: Move player  
- **Space**: Shoot  

## Purpose

This project is mainly for fun and learning, to explore game development and revive old-school arcade classics.
